# Programming Collective Intelligence Building: Smart Web 2.0 Applications (Toby Segaran)

This repository contains tests and examples developed by me based on the book Programming Collective Intelligence Building: Smart Web 2.0 Applications (Toby Segaran).

Programming Collective Intelligence takes you into the world of machine learning and statistics, and explains how to draw conclusions about user experience, marketing, personal tastes, and human behavior in general -- all from information that you and others collect every day.
